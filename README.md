# Kubernetes-KeyVault-FlexVolume #

Azure Key Vault FlexVolume for Kubernetes - Integrates Azure Key Vault with Kubernetes via a FlexVolume.  

With the Azure Key Vault FlexVolume, developers can access application-specific secrets, keys, and certs stored in Azure Key Vault directly from their pods.

**Project Status**: Alpha

## Design

The detailed design of this solution:

- [Concept](/docs/concept.md)

## How to use ##

### Prerequisites: ### 

üí° Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster

### Install the KeyVault Flexvolume ###

```bash

kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/kubernetes-keyvault-flexvol/master/deployment/kv-flexvol-installer.yaml
```
To validate the installer is running as expected, run the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kv
```

You should see the keyvault flexvolume installer pods running on each agent node:

```bash
kv-flexvol-installer-f7bx8   1/1       Running   0          3m
kv-flexvol-installer-rcxbl   1/1       Running   0          3m
kv-flexvol-installer-z6jm6   1/1       Running   0          3m
```
### Use the KeyVault FlexVolume ###

The KeyVault FlexVolume offers two modes for accessing a Key Vault instance: Service Principal and Pod Idenity.

#### OPTION 1 - Service Principal ####

Add your service principal credentials as a Kubernetes secrets accessible by the KeyVault FlexVolume driver.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic kvcreds --from-literal clientid=<CLIENTID> --from-literal clientsecret=<CLIENTSECRET> --type="azure/kv‚Äù
```

Ensure this service principal has all the required permissions to access content in your key vault instance. 
If not, you can run the following using the Azure cli:

```bash
az keyvault set-policy -n $KV_NAME --key-permissions get list --spn <YOUR SPN CLIENT ID>
az keyvault set-policy -n $KV_NAME --secret-permissions get list --spn <YOUR SPN CLIENT ID>
az keyvault set-policy -n $KV_NAME --certificate-permissions get list --spn <YOUR SPN CLIENT ID>
```

Fill in the missing pieces in your deployment like [this](https://github.com/Azure/kubernetes-keyvault-flexvol/blob/master/deployment/nginx-flex-kv.yaml), make sure to:

1. reference the service principal kubernetes secret created in the previous step
```yaml
secretRef:
  name: kvcreds
```
2. pass in properties for the Key Vault instance to the flexvolume driver.

|Name|Required|Description|Default Value|
|---|---|---|---|
|usePodIdentity|no|specify access mode: service principal or pod identity|"false"|
|keyvaultname|yes|name of key vault instance|""|
|keyvaultobjectname|yes|name of key vault object to access|""|
|keyvaultobjecttype|yes|key vault object type: secret, key, cert|""|
|keyvaultobjectversion|yes|key vault object version|""|
|resourcegroup|yes|name of resource group containing key vault instance|""|
|subscriptionid|yes|name of subscription containing key vault instance|""|
|tenantid|yes|name of tenant containing key vault instance|""|

Example of an nginx pod accessing a secret from a key vault instance:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-flex-kv
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-flex-kv
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: test
      mountPath: /kvmnt
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: test
    flexVolume:
      driver: "azure/kv"
      secretRef:
        name: kvcreds # mounting point to the pod
      options:
        usePodIdentity: "false"
        keyvaultname: "testkeyvault"
        keyvaultobjectname: "testsecret"
        keyvaultobjecttype: secret # OPTIONS: secret, key, cert
        keyvaultobjectversion: "testversion"
        resourcegroup: "testresourcegroup"
        subscriptionid: "testsub"
        tenantid: "testtenant"
```

Deploy pod

```bash
kubectl create -f deployment/nginx-flex-kv.yaml
```

Validate the pod has access to the secret from key vault:

```bash
k exec -it nginx-flex-kv cat /kvmnt/testsecret
testvalue
```

#### OPTION 2 - Pod identity ####

##### Prerequisites: #####

üí° Make sure you have installed pod identity to your Kubernetes cluster

Follow [these steps](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity#deploy-the-azure-aad-identity-infra) to install pod identity.

Ensure your Azure user identity has all the required permissions to access content in your key vault instance. 
If not, you can run the following using the Azure cli:

```bash
az keyvault set-policy -n $KV_NAME --key-permissions get list --spn <YOUR AZURE USER IDENTITY CLIENT ID>
az keyvault set-policy -n $KV_NAME --secret-permissions get list --spn <YOURAZURE USER IDENTITY CLIENT ID>
az keyvault set-policy -n $KV_NAME --certificate-permissions get list --spn <YOUR AZURE USER IDENTITY CLIENT ID>
```

Fill in the missing pieces in your deployment like [this](https://github.com/Azure/kubernetes-keyvault-flexvol/blob/master/deployment/nginx-flex-kv-podidentity.yaml), make sure to update the following in your yaml:

1. Include the `aadpodidbinding` label so that this pod will be assigned an identity
```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx-flex-kv-int
    aadpodidbinding: "NAME OF the AzureIdentityBinding SELECTOR"
```
2. make sure to update `usePodIdentity` to `true`
```yaml
usePodIdentity: "true"
```
Deploy pod

```bash
kubectl create -f deployment/nginx-flex-kv-podidentity.yaml
```

Validate the pod has access to the secret from key vault:

```bash
k exec -it nginx-flex-kv-podid cat /kvmnt/testsecret
testvalue
```
